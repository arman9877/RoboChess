# ‚ôüÔ∏è RoboChess

RoboChess is a robotic chess-playing system that integrates:
- **Kinova Gen3 Lite robotic arm** (using Kortex API)
- **Computer vision** (OpenCV)
- **Stockfish chess engine**
- **ROS (Robot Operating System)** on Ubuntu

The robot observes the chessboard, decides on the best move using Stockfish, and physically executes the move using the Kinova arm. It also supports playing against a human.
